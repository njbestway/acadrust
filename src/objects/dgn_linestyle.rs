//! DGN LineStyle objects (`AcDbLS*`).
//!
//! Drawings converted from MicroStation DGN carry their custom line styles as
//! DGN line-style objects rather than standard DWG linetype patterns. The
//! standard `LTYPE` table entry for such a linetype is empty (0 dashes); the
//! real definition lives in these objects, linked through the linetype's
//! extension dictionary (`DGNLSDEF` entry).
//!
//! The object graph is:
//! ```text
//! LineType (empty)
//!   -> xdictionary -> DGNLSDEF -> AcDbLSDefinition (name -> root component)
//!        -> AcDbLSCompoundComponent   (children: point + stroke components)
//!             -> AcDbLSStrokePatternComponent  (dash pattern)
//!             -> AcDbLSPointComponent          (places symbols along a stroke)
//!                  -> AcDbLSSymbolComponent    (references an anonymous block)
//! ```
//!
//! # Decoding status
//! The object header (`description`, component `type`) and the component tree
//! (hard-pointer handle references) are decoded. The leaf placement / pattern
//! data-stream fields (stroke dash lengths, point offsets, symbol scale /
//! rotation / offset) are **not yet decoded** — the objects are still stored
//! verbatim as [`crate::objects::ObjectType::Unknown`] so the DWG round-trips
//! byte-for-byte; these typed structs are the read-side view for rendering.
