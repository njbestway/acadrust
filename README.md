**A pure Rust crate for reading, writing, and inspecting CAD files.**

acadrust handles ASCII and binary DXF plus native binary DWG without requiring
an installed CAD application. File support spans DXF R12 through R2018+ and DWG
R13 through R2018+.

## Quick Start

```toml
[dependencies]
acadrust = "0.5.5"
```

```rust
use acadrust::{DxfReader, DxfWriter};

fn main() -> acadrust::Result<()> {
    let doc = DxfReader::from_file("input.dxf")?.read()?;
    println!("{} entities", doc.entities().count());

    DxfWriter::new(&doc).write_to_file("output.dxf")?;
    Ok(())
}
```

`DxfReader` detects ASCII and binary input automatically. To produce binary
DXF, use `DxfWriter::new_binary(&doc)`.

### Cargo features

| Feature | Default | Adds |
|---------|---------|------|
| `serde` | No | `Serialize` and `Deserialize` implementations for document types |
| `import` | No | STL, COLLADA, OBJ, glTF/GLB, and FBX importers |

Enable optional features as needed:

```toml
[dependencies]
acadrust = { version = "0.5.5", features = ["serde", "import"] }
```

## Features

- **DXF I/O** — ASCII and binary formats, R12 through R2018+
- **DWG I/O** — Native binary formats, R13 through R2018+
- **Broad entity coverage** — 48 top-level `EntityType` variants covering 2D
  geometry, annotations, dimensions, meshes, underlays, viewports, 3D solids,
  regions, bodies, and native surfaces
- **ACIS modeling data** — SAT/SAB parsing and writing, B-rep topology, solid
  history, and primitive builders
- **Tables and objects** — Layers, linetypes, styles, dictionaries, layouts,
  materials, fields, dynamic blocks, and associative data
- **Resilient reads** — Optional failsafe recovery with bounded, structured
  diagnostics and read statistics
- **Encoding support** — Automatic handling of roughly 40 code pages for
  pre-2007 drawings
- **Optional serialization** — Serde support for document data
- **Optional 3D imports** — STL, COLLADA, OBJ, glTF/GLB, and FBX converted to
  acadrust documents

## File Version Support

| File code | AutoCAD release | DXF | DWG |
|-----------|-----------------|-----|-----|
| AC1009 | R12 | R/W | — |
| AC1012 | R13 | R/W | R/W |
| AC1014 | R14 | R/W | R/W |
| AC1015 | 2000 | R/W | R/W |
| AC1018 | 2004 | R/W | R/W |
| AC1021 | 2007 | R/W | R/W |
| AC1024 | 2010 | R/W | R/W |
| AC1027 | 2013 | R/W | R/W |
| AC1032 | 2018+ | R/W | R/W |

`R/W` means read and write support. Entity availability varies by file version;
see the [per-version compatibility matrix](src/docs/entity_status_matrix.md)
for results from the 71-case entity atlas. The matrix records tested fixtures
and CAD-engine audit results, not a guarantee for every possible drawing.

## Changelog

### 0.5.5

- **Cross-application compatibility atlas** — Added a 71-case entity atlas,
  version-aware fixtures, isolated-case validation, and generated audit matrices
  for AutoCAD and BricsCAD across AC1012 through AC1032.
- **DWG compatibility** — Improved AC1021 Reed-Solomon handling, legacy viewport
  records, class metadata, table styles, annotative context data, arc-aligned
  text, and complete database-record output.
- **ACIS and native surfaces** — Preserved solid-history edits, pcurves, NURBS
  data, SAT/SAB tokens, multi-body datastores, and lofted, revolved, swept, and
  extruded surface construction data across round trips.
- **DXF fidelity** — Corrected binary group-code widths, legacy space aliases,
  handle allocation, typed raw-record output, and audit failures in native
  surface records.
- **Stable editing and output** — Preserved opaque source data when editing
  known records and ordered written objects by handle for deterministic output.

### 0.5.4

- **DXF handle integrity (issue #64)** — Symbol-table control handles are preserved on read, so tables written by files with non-default handles no longer collide with file-sourced records on round-trip (LAYER and BLOCK_RECORD previously shared handle #1).
- **Root dictionary resolution (issue #64)** — The reader now resolves the NAMED OBJECTS DICTIONARY after reading the OBJECTS section. The writer emits the real root dictionary first, so consumers no longer audit away dictionaries, layouts, and materials as orphans.
### 0.5.3

- **DIMSTYLE text-style regression, part 2 (issue #64)** - The reader now re-points stale DIMSTYLE text-style handles at the file's same-named text style, so a ByBlock linetype handle can no longer leak into group 340.
- **MLine::close** - The CLOSED flag is set regardless of vertex count (rebuild geometry guards degenerate cases), restoring the API contract.
- **Table bounding box** - Unit test updated to the rotated-table-aware semantics: rows flow downward from the top-left insertion point.
- **DWG handle-less table entries** - Entries added without handles (e.g. Layer::new + layers.add) are assigned fresh handles on DWG save on a cloned document, so they no longer disappear from re-opened drawings and the handle map stays consistent.
### 0.5.2

- **DIMSTYLE text-style regression (issue #64)** - Fixed a 0.5.1 regression where a DXF round-trip wrote a ByBlock linetype handle as the DIMSTYLE text style (group 340): when the input file replaced the default Standard text style at a colliding handle, the surviving default DIMSTYLE kept pointing at the stale numeric handle. Stale text-style references are now re-pointed at the file's same-named text style on read.
- **Dimension fidelity** - Angular dimension quadrant measurements, radius/diameter point semantics, ordinate datum references, and dimension geometry/override consistency are preserved through round-trips.
- **ACIS enhancements** - Exact spline geometry is written, parametric pcurves decode, cone history radius semantics are defined, and solid boundary geometry is corrected.
- **Table entities** - Structural integrity is preserved and header suppression overrides are honored.
- **MText / Tolerance** - MText columns are encoded safely and preserved in DXF; geometric tolerance orientation and style identity are preserved.
- **Curves and surfaces** - Spline transformed geometry with tangents and tolerances, helix transform precision, world-space circle and arc bounds, circle thickness in bounds, and persistent center mark / centerline association metadata.
- **Hatch / Wipeout / Sketch** - Hatch boundary flags are preserved, wipeout geometry and display data survive with frames visible by default, and freehand sketch settings round-trip.
- **Layers and color books** - Layer color book identity survives DWG, DXF, and layer-state round-trips; layer rename references are preserved; the current layer state is restored on DWG save and child entity ownership is kept.
- **Transparency** - The inheritance method is preserved with a serde-friendly enum shape.
- **DWG saves** - AC1015 records are preserved, saved viewport cameras are restored, and earlier round-trip regressions are repaired.

### 0.5.1

- **Docs cleanup** - Removed the stale "IFCCAD foundation" feature bullet from the README (the feature never shipped in the published crate).

### 0.5.0

- **BricsCAD / AutoCAD 2026 compatibility** — Round-tripped DXF files now open without the recovery prompt: EED handles are decoded/encoded big-endian, `$PSTYLEMODE` is written as a boolean (290) so layer plot-style references validate, the ACAD RegApp record is emitted first, built-in materials use the minimal form, unrestorable associative-framework objects and empty map file names are dropped, dictionary-with-default records match BricsCAD's export, and `$CELWEIGHT` is sanitized to a valid lineweight.

- **DXF read/write cycle stability** — Handle-less records (R12-era files) receive handles, colliding defaults are re-handled, `DictionaryWithDefault::default_handle` follows remapped objects, MLINESTYLE angles round-trip in degrees/radians symmetrically, and NOD entry ownership matches what the writer emits. Duplicate handles and dangling references that made CAD applications discard drawings are gone.

- **DWG decoding fixes** — AC15 (R13–R2000) files whose AuxHeader sits behind the Handles section now read fully (AcDbObjects inferred from the Classes-to-Handles gap); code-page strings and MIF `\U+XXXX` escapes decode correctly, with unmappable characters written as MIF escapes.

- **AC1032 writer fixes (issue #45)** — `$ACADMAINTVER` uses group code 90, manually added layers get real non-zero handles below `$HANDSEED`, and LAYER records carry the required 390 plot-style pointer.

- **LWPOLYLINE down-save** — Plain 2D polylines are written as LWPOLYLINE for R2000+ output instead of the legacy POLYLINE/VERTEX/SEQEND form, matching what CAD applications expect (issue #63 follow-up).

- **DXF hard-owner alignment (issue #63)** — `ACAD_FIELD` is written as a hard owner (360) so applications no longer erase it; remaining NOD entries match BricsCAD's own export.

- **Community contributions** — Solid history graph management, exact ACIS spline topology, lump/shell chain traversal, block record base points, viewport shadow layer normalization, case-insensitive space records, entity extension-dictionary remapping, large mesh face stream preservation, and dimension definition point fixes.


### 0.4.1

- **MTEXT formatting** — Added a structured MTEXT format parser with richer control-code handling, including escaped semicolons, caret codes, legacy `%%u`/`%%o`/`%%nnn` text codes, line-spacing style, and relative-vs-absolute height scalars.

- **Expanded entity coverage** — Added read/write and round-trip support for `HELIX`, `ACAD_TABLE` cell content, PDF/DWF/DGN underlay references and definitions, ACAD surface entities, SPATIAL_FILTER clip boundaries, complex linetype shapes/text, and additional surface/body/history fields.

- **ACIS and 3D solid reliability** — Improved planar B-rep and NURBS spline-surface output, transformed ACIS body geometry correctly, linked R2013+ 3DSOLID/REGION/BODY geometry to AcDs SAB blobs, and fixed several AcDs record pairing/search/index layouts.

- **DWG/DXF interoperability fixes** — Tightened DWG writer conformance for AutoCAD round-trips, R2018 MLEADER/MTEXT column handling, viewport and plot settings persistence, xref block preservation, ENC color/transparency decoding, spline scenario detection, dimension angles/group codes, TEXT thickness/generation flags, and POLYLINE routing by flags.

- **Performance and security** — Removed quadratic AcDs SAB scans, made `SatDocument::record()` O(1), bounded SAB end-marker searches, and added a JSON recursion depth limit to prevent stack-overflow denial of service in glTF import.


### 0.4.0

- **Annotative styles** — `TextStyle`, `DimStyle`, and `TableStyle` now carry an `annotative` flag, persisted the standard way via `AcadAnnotative` XDATA/EED in both DXF and DWG.

- **AcDbGeoData decode** — DWG reader now decodes the `AcDbGeoData` coordinate-system definition.

- **CANNOSCALE header vars** — Read/write support for the `CANNOSCALE` and `CANNOSCALEVALUE` header variables in DXF.

- **VPORT visual style** — Render mode / visual style is persisted through both DXF and DWG; duplicate and tiled `*Active` VPORT entries are preserved instead of being collapsed.

- **Layout paper dimensions** — Paper size and plot rotation are exposed on `Layout`.

- **DWG reader robustness** — Hatch boundary-handle counts capped with `safe_count`; raster-image / wipeout clip-boundary vertices retained; 3DFACE corners 2–4 always decode Z with BD-default; invalid page offsets from gap entries no longer computed.

- **DXF reader fixes** — Improved 3D-point header parsing, null entity-handle allocation, BlockRecord initialization ordering, and configurable default encoding. Mirrored explode now produces correct arc/ellipse handedness and OCS centers.

- **DWG roundtrip** — Roundtrip workflows across supported versions with newline sanitization and improved reader alignment handling.


### 0.3.4

- **DWG roundtrip expanded** — Roundtrip workflows now cover supported DWG versions end-to-end, with additional byte-level diagnostics and compatibility fixes in the writer pipeline.

- **DXF output compatibility** — ASCII and Binary DXF roundtrip support tightened across multiple versions, including symbol name sanitization, corrected subclass marker emission, and newline-to-`\P` paragraph marker conversion in Binary DXF strings.

- **ACIS downgrade support** — ACIS SAT/SAB handling now downgrades incompatible record layouts for older consumers, improving 3DSOLID interoperability.

- **AC1021 encoding fix** — Corrected RS encoding behavior for AutoCAD 2007-class DWG files.


### 0.3.2

- **Entity explode** — `EntityType::explode()` decomposes complex entities (polylines, hatches, meshes, dimensions, etc.) into simpler primitives (lines, arcs, faces); `CadDocument::explode_entity()` allocates handles automatically

- **Centralized transform/mirror/translate** — Transformation logic extracted from 38 entity files into `translate.rs`, `transform.rs`, and `mirror.rs` modules; all Entity trait implementations delegate to these centralized functions. Direct `EntityType` dispatch methods added (`entity.translate()`, `entity.apply_transform()`, `entity.mirror_x()`, etc.) alongside the existing trait-based API.

- **DWG parser/writer fixes**

### 0.3.0

- **ACI color support** — Full 256-entry AutoCAD Color Index (ACI) to RGB lookup table, `Color::rgb()` resolves index colors, `Color::approximate_index()` finds nearest ACI match for true colors

- **Hatch edge fix** — Corrected hatch edge reading/writing issues

- **LwPolyline bulge fix** — Fixed bulge value handling in parser and writer

- **Performance optimizations** — Zero-allocation number formatting with `itoa`/`ryu`, buffered I/O, reduced memory allocations throughout DXF read/write pipeline. Parsing/writing speed are dramatically increased.

- **Table entry deduplication** — `add_or_replace` for table entries eliminates handle collisions during read

#### Breaking API change

- **`BlockRecord` entity storage** — `BlockRecord` now stores `entity_handles: Vec<Handle>` instead of owning entities directly. All entities live in flat storage inside `CadDocument` with O(1) handle-based lookup. If you accessed block entities directly, use `doc.get_entity(handle)` instead:
  ```rust
  // Before (0.2.x): iterating block entities directly
  // for entity in &block_record.entities { ... }

  // After (0.3.0): resolve handles through the document
  for &handle in &block_record.entity_handles {
      if let Some(entity) = doc.get_entity(handle) {
          // use entity
      }
  }
  ```
  The `CadDocument` public API (`add_entity()`, `entities()`, `get_entity()`, `get_entity_mut()`) is unchanged.

### 0.2.10

- **Paper space & layout support** — `add_paper_space_entity()`, `add_entity_to_layout()`, `add_layout()` API for creating viewports in multiple paper space layouts
- **Correct DXF paper space structure** — Active layout (`*Paper_Space`) entities in ENTITIES section with code 67; non-active layouts (`*Paper_Space0`, `*Paper_Space1`, …) entities inside BLOCK definitions
- **AutoCAD AUDIT compatibility** — Fixed code 67 paper space flag, MLineStyle angle conversion (radians→degrees), AcDbPlotSettings flag, viewport owner handles
- **DXF reader** — Proper handling of code 67 (paper space flag) in common entity parsing

### 0.2.9

- **ACIS 3DSOLID write support** — SAT text builder (R2000–R2007) and SAB binary (R2013+) with primitives: box, wedge, pyramid, cylinder, cone, sphere, torus
- **`SatDocument` builder API** — `add_plane_surface`, `add_cone_surface`, `add_sphere_surface`, `add_torus_surface`, `add_straight_curve`, `add_ellipse_curve`
- **208/208 DWG roundtrip integrity** — Zero field drift across 26 entity types × 8 versions

### 0.2.8

- **DWG binary read** — Full DWG reader for R13 through R2018
- **DWG binary write** — Full DWG writer for R13 through R2018
- **Handle resolution** — Automatic owner handle assignment after read

### 0.2.7

- **Optional serde support** — `Serialize`/`Deserialize` for all document types with `features = ["serde"]`
- **JSON/YAML round-trip** — Full document serialization and deserialization

### 0.2.6

- **41 entity types** — Added MultiLeader, Table, MLine, Mesh, Underlay, Ole2Frame, Wipeout, Shape, and more
- **Objects** — Dictionaries, Groups, Layouts, MLineStyle, MultiLeaderStyle, TableStyle, PlotSettings, Scale, Materials, VisualStyle, GeoData
- **CLASSES section** — Full read/write support
- **Extended data (XData)** — Full support for application-specific extended data
- **Reactors & extension dictionaries** — Read/write for all entity and object types

### 0.2.0–0.2.5

- ASCII and Binary DXF read/write
- Core entity types (Point, Line, Circle, Arc, Ellipse, Polyline, LwPolyline, Text, MText, Spline, Dimension, Hatch, Solid, Face3D, Insert, Viewport)
- Table system (Layer, LineType, TextStyle, DimStyle, BlockRecord, AppId, View, VPort, UCS)
- Encoding support (~40 code pages)
- Failsafe reading mode
